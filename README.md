# Diarizers

Diarizers is a library for fine-tuning speaker diarisation models from [`pyannote`](https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio/tree/develop) using hugging face tools.It provides scripts to: 

- Convert Speaker Diarization datasets into Hugging Face datasets compatible with `diarizers`. 
- Train from scratch or fine-tune speaker diarization models using the Hugging Face `Trainer`. 
- Evaluate the models at inference time. 
-  Convert the fine-tuned models into a format compatible with `pyannote`.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This library can only be used to fine-tune the [segmentation model](https://huggingface.co/pyannote/segmentation-3.0) from the `pyannote` [speaker diarization pipeline](https://huggingface.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1) for now. 
> Future work will aim to help optimise the full pipeline hyperparameters.

## Installation

Diarizers has light-weight dependencies and can be installed with the following lines:

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/diarizers.git
pip install diarizers[dev]
```

You'll need to generate a [user access token](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/security-tokens), and login using: 

```
hugging-cli login
```


## Fine-Tune: 

```
python3 train_segmentation.py
    --dataset_name="kamilakesbi/real_ami_ihm" \
    --from_pretrained=True \
    --lr='1e-3'\
    --batch_size='32'\
    --epochs='3'\
    --do_init_eval=True\
    --checkpoint_path='checkpoints/ami'\
    --save_model=True \
    --num_proc='12'
```

## Test: 

```
python3 test_segmentation.py \
   --dataset_name="kamilakesbi/real_ami_ihm" \
   --pretrained_or_finetuned='finetuned' \
   --checkpoint_path='checkpoints/ami'
```

## Use in pyannote: 

- Use the fine-tuned segmentation model within a speaker diarization pipeline: 

```python
from diarizers import SegmentationModel
from pyannote.audio import Pipeline

# load the pre-trained pyannote pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline.from_pretrained("pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1")

# replace the segmentation model with your fine-tuned one
model = SegmentationModel().from_pretrained("diarizers-community/speaker-segmentation-fine-tuned-callhome-jpn")
model = model.to_pyannote_model()
pipeline.segmentation_model = model

# perform inference
diarization_output = pipeline("audio.mp3")

# dump the diarization output to disk using RTTM format
with open("audio.rttm", "w") as rttm:
    diarization.write_rttm(rttm)
```

## Datasets

Features: 

- `audio`:
